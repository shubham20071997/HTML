<!-- A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text. -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed: -->
<p>
    This paragraph
    contains         a lot of spaces
    in the source         code,
    but the        browser
    ignores it.
</p>

<!-- To solve this problem use The HTML <pre> element which means preformatted text. -->
<pre>
    This paragraph
    contains         a lot of spaces
    in the source         code,
    but the        browser
    ignores it.
</pre>

<!-- HTML Horizontal Rules
The <hr> element is used to separate content in an HTML page: -->
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>

<!-- HTML Line Breaks
Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph: -->
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
